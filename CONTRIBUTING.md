# Contributing
Contributing to this repository is simple. The files to edit can be found in the `configs/` folder and they each have their owned defined structures. When editing files, please ensure that there are no syntax errors with the YAML if applicable. Please follow the format that's been used on other files as they are a great indicator of how I want things to be done for Canister's Manifests.

On a pull request, you may add as many commits as you want, however, they will be squashed and merged into the main branch, triggering a redeploy and updating the live site. If you have push access, please be careful to not disrupt the deploy action lifecycle.
